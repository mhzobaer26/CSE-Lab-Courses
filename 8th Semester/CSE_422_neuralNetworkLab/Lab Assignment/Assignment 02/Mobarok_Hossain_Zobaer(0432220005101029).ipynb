In my labeling rule, a person needs at least two healthy habits to be \"Fit.\" If we remove the water intake data, the model can only see two features. If a person fails in \"Activity\" but is healthy in both \"Sleep\" and \"Water,\" the model will incorrectly label them as \"Unfit\" because it can no longer see the water intake data.\n",

Removing one feature makes the boundary \"blurry,\" as two people with different health levels might look identical to the model, leading to misclassification.\n",
