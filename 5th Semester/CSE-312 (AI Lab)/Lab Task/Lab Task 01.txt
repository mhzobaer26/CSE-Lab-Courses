Imagine you're working with temperature data from a weather station, recorded hourly for one week. The data is stored in a 2D Numpy array where each row represents a day of the week and each column represents the temperature at a specific hour.

1. Create 7x24 Numpy array with random temperature values between -5° to 30°C. 
2. Calculate the average temperature for each day.
3. Calculate max and min temperature for each day.
4. Find the total number of hours in the week when the temp is below O°C.
5. Calculate the overall temp. of the week
