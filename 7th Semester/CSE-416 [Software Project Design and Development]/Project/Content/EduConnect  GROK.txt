Figma Design Prompt for EduConnect: Educational Platform for Bangladeshi Students
Design a high-fidelity Figma prototype for "EduConnect - A Smart Education Service Platform," a modern, user-friendly educational app for Bangladeshi students (Class 1 to University). The platform unifies NCTB eBooks, results checking, admissions, study materials, AI assistance, and news/deadlines. Focus on seamless integration between the Online Admission Hub and Mock University Portal, where actions in the Admission Hub (e.g., application submission) instantly update the Mock University Portal (e.g., show submitted application). Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, forms) are functional in the prototype with realistic transitions, animations, and dynamic data using Figma variables. Design for desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) with accessibility in mind.

Implementation Notes

Variables: Use Figma variables for Name, Roll, Board, ApplicationID, Institution, Status to simulate dynamic data.
Dynamic Link: In Admission Hub, "Apply Now" sets variables (e.g., ApplicationID: DU2025APP12345, Institution: DU). Mock University Portal checks variables to update table (e.g., if Institution = DU, add row to DU table).
Organization: Group layers by screen (e.g., "Homepage", "Admission Hub"). Name frames clearly.
Export: Share prototype link for demo.

This design unifies fragmented educational services, with seamless Admission Hub to Mock University Portal integration, ensuring submissions instantly reflect in the portal for a realistic, trustworthy experience.
